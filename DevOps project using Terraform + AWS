🏁 Goal:
Create and host a simple static website (like an HTML page) using:

✅ AWS S3 (to store website files)

✅ Terraform (to write and manage everything as code)

💻 Project Overview: What You’ll Do
Step	Task
1️⃣	Set up AWS account and Terraform
2️⃣	Write Terraform code to create an S3 bucket
3️⃣	Upload your HTML file to that bucket
4️⃣	Host it as a website from S3
5️⃣	Access your website in browser 🎉

🧰 What You Need
A working AWS account

Install:

Terraform

AWS CLI (optional but useful)

One HTML file (like index.html) – a simple webpage

🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup
🔹 Step 1: Configure AWS CLI
bash
Copy
Edit
aws configure
Enter:

AWS Access Key ID

Secret Access Key

Default region (e.g., us-east-1)

🔹 Step 2: Create a Terraform File (main.tf)
hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "static_site" {
  bucket = "suhani-static-site-demo"
  acl    = "public-read"

  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "index" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.static_site.id
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "index.html"
  acl    = "public-read"
  content_type = "text/html"
}
🔸 Make sure index.html file is in the same folder.

🔹 Step 3: Initialize Terraform
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init
👉 This sets up Terraform in your folder.

🔹 Step 4: Apply Your Changes (Deploy)
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform apply
Confirm with yes when it asks.

Terraform will:

Create the S3 bucket

Upload your HTML file

Configure it as a website

🔹 Step 5: Access the Website
After apply, you'll get a link like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://suhani-static-site-demo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Open it in a browser — ✨ your site is live!

🎁 Bonus: Sample index.html
Here’s a simple HTML file:

html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Terraform Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello from Suhani!</h1>
  <p>This website is hosted using Terraform + AWS S3 🌍</p>
</body>
</html>
Save it as index.html in the same folder as your .tf file.
