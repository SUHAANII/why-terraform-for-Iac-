## ðŸ§  What is AWS CLI?

AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that allows you to interact with AWS services from your terminal or shell. It lets you control AWS resources using commands instead of the web interface.

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Manage infrastructure directly from your terminal
- Combine commands in scripts to build DevOps workflows
- Works well with CI/CD pipelines

### ðŸ“¦ Common AWS CLI Commands:
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Create an S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket-name

# Upload a file to S3
aws s3 cp index.html s3://my-bucket-name/

# List EC2 instances
aws ec2 describe-instances

# Start an EC2 instance
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
